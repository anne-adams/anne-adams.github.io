    <h1>Big tech is painting itself as journalism’s <br>
        saviour. We should tread carefully

    <p>
        We’ve long been warned about the looming demise of traditional journalism in <br>
        the face of digital disruption. But some tech giants, once the very disruptors <br>
        themselves, have been positioning themselves as journalism’s saviours.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Programs such as the <b>Google News Initiative</b> promise not only to keep journalism <br> 
        alive, but by enabling innovation, to also help it adapt and thrive into the future.
    </p> 
    <p>
        We set out to explore how big tech’s <q>philanthrocapitalism</q> could be reshaping <br>
        the news industry, focusing on countries in the Global South, where such funding <br>
        can play an outsized role.

    <h2>A double-edged sword</h2> 
    <p>
        Big tech is now deeply enmeshed with modern journalism. Platforms such as <br>
        Google and Facebook are at the heart of the way news is distributed, and new <br>
        players like OpenAI are revolutionising the way we create content.
    </p>
    <p>
        These companies admittedly provide vital digital infrastructure that has enabled <br>
        much of the innovation we’ve seen in journalism over the past decade. But they’re <br>
        also the entities that disrupted the traditional news business model in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2>Some success stories</h2>
    <p>
        That isn’t to say there weren’t any success stories. Google even encouraged some <br>
        organisations to plan for long term sustainability early on, including Stears, a <br>
        legacy media company in Nigeria.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stears acknowledged the benefits of Google’s advice to plan for the long term.

        If sustainability wasn’t a major consideration from the beginning, things could have <br>
        been different … because the Google team encouraged us to prioritize sustainability <br>
        from the outset, it will be a matter of returning to our normal day-to-day operations <br>
        and aligning our expenses accordingly.
