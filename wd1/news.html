        Is big tech painting itself as journalism’s saviour?
    </h2>

    <h2>Online news consumption has surpassed television – but broadcasters are still the most widely trusted</h2>
    <p>
        Stephen Cushion discusses the shift in the UK's news consumption habits, where online sources have overtaken television <br>
        for the first time. Despite this change, traditional broadcasters like the BBC continue to be the most trusted news <br>
        providers, especially during significant events such as elections and public health crises. <br>
        The article highlights that while younger audiences increasingly access news via social media, much of the content <br>
        originates from established media outlets, indicating that trust in traditional journalism remains strong even in the<br>
        digital age.
